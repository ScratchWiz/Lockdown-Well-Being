# Lockdown Well-Being
My game - Lockdown Well-Being - encourages people (_who are stuck in Lockdown_) to become more sprightly, energetic, and active without succumbing to sadness. During Lockdown, people may become **idle** or **lethargic**, and this can develop a foundation for many consequences. These consequences can include adequate fat, increased boredom, and other negative effects.
## How to play:-
Objective of the game is to keep the Well-Being Score high. If your score drops to zero, you will lose the game.
1) Press the start button to play
2) Use the arrow keys to move the person towards the activities
3) Press 'b' to start the activity
4) When the activity starts, the Well-Being Score will increase but after some time, the score will start to decrease - Too much of anything is not good.
5) Press 'e' to stop the activity
6) Repeat this for different activities by moving around
## Hope you enjoy!
